I named this game Flappy Angry Bird because I used Red from Angry Birds to mimic the famous mobile game known as the Flappy bird.

I created this game using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library(SFML) and C++ in Visual Studio. I used SFML for graphics and user interface because it is a very efficient and straightforward tool that can be used to create 2d games.

It was my first time working with a graphics library, and I learned a lot and had fun during the process.
